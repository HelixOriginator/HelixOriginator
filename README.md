 Contribution Acknowledgement: Novelty Scoring Feedback
In July 2025, I submitted feedback to the DeSci Lab team on how “unknown” context novelty scores are interpreted in their system. My suggestion was acknowledged, forwarded to their product team for consideration in future updates, and I was invited to resubmit a revised manuscript incorporating this input.

This recognition reflects my ability to spot meaningful gaps in algorithmic logic and contribute to more accurate, user-aligned systems in scientific publishing and AI-assisted research.



 🧠 Strategic Advisory – DeSci Lab (April 2025)
Contributed an 8-point strategy to elevate DeSci Lab’s visibility, engagement, and policy reach. Highlights include:
- Translating top research into 50+ languages
- Facilitating grants with 2–5% return for DeSci
- Promoting novelty-rated research via press, social, and certification
- Leveraging content as policy input in emerging economies  
✅ Summary submitted post-Zoom via formal memo
 
 One of my concepts appreciated by ILO and ILR reviewers
